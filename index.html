      <p>
      Hi, I’m Patty Ngo <br>
      I am a digital media artist specializing in graphic design, 3D animation, and video production. I find great inspiration in themes of natural conservation, Asian American representation, and cultural appreciation. Through my artwork, I strive to create a captivating experience that transcends reality, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in a whimsical and heartwarming world. I aim to uplift and transport viewers to a realm where their worries fade away, allowing them to reconnect with their inner child. My goal is to kindle a sense of wonder and delight, fostering a deep appreciation for the beauty of our natural environment and the diverse tapestry of cultures that enrich our lives.</p>
      <p>
      My interest in creating art sparked at an early age. Coming from a family of Vietnamese immigrants with limited financial resources, I quickly learned the art of resourcefulness. If I wanted toys, I had to craft them myself. I spent all my free time in elementary school drawing or making little clay sculptures. It wasn’t until high school that I realized that art was my main passion. I enrolled in a media arts program called Media Communications Academy. I learned the fundamentals of art and the basics of Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and many other digital art software. In September 2017, I became the president of this academy and I was able to inspire other students to channel their inner artists. </p>
      <p>
      After high school, I wanted to continue pursuing art at a facility that would allow me to grow as an artist. I enrolled in San Jose State’s Digital Media Art program which is led by a faculty of highly experienced artists. I expanded my range of knowledge and tried out mediums that I was previously intimidated by. This included using digital tools such as coding and 3D modeling, as well as physical skills like woodworking and welding. This part of my journey propelled me to new heights of creativity and self-discovery. </p>
      <p>
      Since earning my BFA degree in Spring 2022, I have been dedicating myself to crafting a portfolio that truly embodies my unique artistic style. As you explore my work, I hope you will find pieces that captivate you and leave a lasting impression. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity for future collaborations, as I continue to push the boundaries of my creativity. Thank you for your interest, and I hope you thoroughly enjoy your journey through my artistic endeavors. </p> <br> <br>
