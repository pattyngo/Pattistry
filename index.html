      <p>
      My name is Patty and I am an artist hat creates whimsical, eye-catching artwork that includes themes of nature. The concepts for my artwork are very broad and imaginative. I want to give the viewer the experience of stepping into a whole new world. I would describe my art as dystopian surrealism. </p>
      <p>
      Creating art has always been something that was important to me. I began taking art courses in 2012 when I was given the opportunity to work on my middle school’s yearbook. I wasn’t until high school when I realized that art was my one main passion. I enrolled in a media arts program within my school called Media Communications Academy. Being in this academy pushed me to constantly try out new techniques. I learned that anything I want to create is achievable as long as I had the drive to complete the task. In September 2017, I became the president of this academy and my goal was to inspire other students to gain a passion for media arts. I had such a good experience learning about media art so I wanted to take all the valuable knowledge I gained and expand the horizons of what I could create. </p>
      <p>
      After looking over my options, I decided to continue my artist journey at the San Jose State University Digital Media Arts BFA program. I have been a student of the art department for three years now and I highly appreciate the never ending support from the faculty. After I receive my bachelor’s degree, I would like to work alongside fellow media artist and possibly pursue a higher education in order to become a media arts teacher. I want to use my skills to help other people. </p>
      <p>
      My portfolio shows the artwork that I believe shows a broad range of my skills. I tried something new in each project, whether that be a different style, medium, or subject matter. This website was a really important learning experience for me because I did not have much coding experience prior to building the site. I wanted to take on the task of designing a website that I would be proud of showing off without using any templates. My goal was to fully understand the fundamentals of coding so I can apply them to future projects. I hope you enjoy browsing through my site. I added a little bee friend to keep you company. </p>
